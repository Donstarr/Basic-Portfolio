                <br> My name is Jake Donovan. I am a working professional and have spent the last 3 years watching Ibotta grow
                from a 50 person company to over 500. While my role at the company has been primarily as an Operation Manager,
                I have moved into the Software development space so I could work better with in house developers.
                <br>
                <br> I currently reside in Denver Colorado. This page will show a basic overview of what I have built in my time
                as a developer. Please reach out if you would like to talk through specifics on how I can help your company
                grow and achieve its goals.
